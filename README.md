# C Utils
This is a very basic set of utility functions written in C. It was tested with Valgrind. Feel free to use it for whatever you want.

## Categories

Functions are divided into following categories:
- Structs and linked lists
- Integers
- Characters
- Strings
- Math
- File I/O

Some of the functions are obviously also available in the C standard library or by simply using operators.
